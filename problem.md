# Potential Problem Source Files

Based on the "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'clientModules')" error that occurs in the Firebase environment but not locally, the issue likely stems from data serialization problems between the server-side Next.js code and the Genkit Cloud Function.

Here are the files that are most likely involved in this issue:

1.  **`src/ai/flows/query-provider-flow.ts`**: This server action is the primary suspect. It acts as the bridge between the frontend and the Genkit flow. The error most likely occurs when this function receives a complex, non-serializable object from the Genkit flow and tries to pass it to the Next.js frontend, which fails during production builds.

2.  **`src/ai/flows/open-router-proxy-flow.ts`**: This file defines the Genkit flow that runs as a Cloud Function. While it correctly fetches data, the object it returns to `query-provider-flow.ts` might contain properties or prototypes that are not simple plain objects, causing the serialization failure in the Next.js server environment.

3.  **`src/components/search/knowledge-gate.tsx`**: This is the client-side component that initiates the call to the `queryProvider` server action. While less likely to be the direct cause, it's the consumer of the data, and the error ultimately manifests when this component is rendered.

4.  **`console log`**: This file contains the raw error logs from Firebase, which was the starting point for this diagnosis. It clearly shows the `TypeError` and the 500 server errors.
